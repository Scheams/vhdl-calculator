## ModelSim
Start ModelSim and change the directory to the msim-directory. Make sure the line "do io_ctrl_sim.do" in the sim.do file is uncommented. Execute the script "do compile.do" then "do sim.do". The simulated waveforms can then be inspected. Type "quit -sim" in the terminal to exit the simulation.
